# Dodge-Em
My first pygame game, a simple 2D game where you (shockingly enough) dodge stuff

The actual gameplay is relatively intuitive, simply use the left and right arrow keys to dodge em!

This game has gone through rigorous testing, however, it was coded in 48 hours so may still contain some bugs.

I hope you enjoy the game!
